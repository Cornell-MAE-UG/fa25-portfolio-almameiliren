For my Mechanics of Engineering Materials course, we were asked to design a torque wrench that satisfies the following performance requirements:
- Attain at least 1.0 mV/V output at the rated torque of 600 in-lbf.
- Safety factor of X~0~ = 4 for yeild or brittle failure.
- Safety factor of X~K~ = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack depth of 0.04 inches.
- Fatigue stress safety factor of X~s~ = 1.5.
